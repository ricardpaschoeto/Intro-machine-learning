# Project - Estimating Boston Real Estate Prices

In this project, you will evaluate the performance and estimation power of a model that has been trained and tested on data collected from real estate in the suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts. A model prepared for such data and seen as well adjusted may then be used for certain estimates about a property - in particular, its monetary value. This model would be of great value to someone as a furniture agent, who could make use of this information daily.
